# workDayScheduler

For this assignment I was given the task to create a color-coded daily planner. 

When you open the planner you will see the current day displayed at the top. 
If you scroll down you will see the planner with the timeblocks for standard business hours on the left hand side, text blocks in the center and a save button on the right hand side. 
The text blocks are color coded to indicated whether they are in the past(gray), present(red) or future(green). 
You are able to enter an event in the text area and save the information into local storage. If you refresh the page it will still available. You can also erase and change the event.
